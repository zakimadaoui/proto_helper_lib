BANNER

Proto+ is a android tool that allows you to create Graphical User Interfaces for your Embedded  projects and prototypes in few minutes !.
The GUIs can be created quickly using drag and drop widgets like: Buttons, Sliders, and knobs. These widgets are highly customizable whether
it is in terms of the physical properties such as the size, color and orientations, but also in terms of the commands that will be sent to
the micro-controller. 

Proto+ can connect to your micro-controller or computer via Bluetooth, TCP/IP or even via UART, and on top of that, the C++ **HelperLibrary** will take care of parsing the recieved commands, generating events when commands are fully recieved and encapsulated the data in objects to keep your code clean and organized.
